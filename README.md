# nucleotide_to_AA_parser
Biopython script for converting SNPs of a multiple genome sequence alignment to an annotated list of amino acid changes. Includes annotations for synonymous/non-synonymous, codon number and position of SNP in codon. 

Requires an [ORF annotation file](orf_positions.csv).

An exemplary CSV output based on 12626 SARS-CoV-2 GISAID genomes can be found [here](sars_cov_2_12626_genomes_ouput.csv).

Reference to the article where this script was used will be provided when possible.
